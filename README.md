# Industry Project - [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/)

One day project for the organization to solve the problem posed by their team. We were a team of four (2 Web Devs + 2 UX Designers). 

We did the research and come up with the below two add ons to their website:

- Top Notification Bar on Homepage with lastest announcements.
- New Menu Option of "What's New".

## Lessons Learned

It was a great collaboration with UX team to see the design approach to solve problems. From research to coming up with personas, it was a well structured process. The biggest challenge was to clone the original website in short time as there were many layers in header section of the homepage.
